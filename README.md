# Custom Simulator
A custom simulator matching the requirements of the EWT Project to model subatomic behavior with classical physics. It provides a microscopic look at molecules, atoms, atomic nuclei, particles and spacetime, using the theoretical model from Energy Wave Theory (EWT).

## Getting Started
A developer has the flexibility to choose their platform of choice to build a simulation matching the requirements of the EWT Project.  The requirements and timeframe of project phases are outlined at http://www.energywavetheory.com/project.  The instructions for checking code into the project, including eligibility for the competition and prizes, are outlined at http://www.energywavetheory.com/project/competition-instructions.
